# requirements.txt
# --------------------
# This file records the packages and requirements needed in order for
# all models of natcap.invest to work as expected.
#
# Packages required for extras (like the UI) are in setup.py.
#
# Note that there may be some OS-specific requirements, so be sure to run
# `make check` to verify you have all the required packages.
#
# Any lines with "# pip-only" at the end will be processed by
# scripts/convert-requirements-to-conda-yml.py as though it can only be found
# on pip.
